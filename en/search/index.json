[{"content":"\r女孩子的脸虽然都是同胚的，但是有的正则性好一点，所以这部分女孩子的脸就格外好看。\n― 网络 The end of this semester\u0026rsquo;s FINAL EXAM has come, and at last I could try to make time to complete this blog. This will be my first time to write a maths blog in English. I\u0026rsquo;ll translate it into Chinese later. Sounds odd\u0026hellip; Why don\u0026rsquo;t I write it in Chinese at very first, but force myself to use English pretending to be a native English speaker? Oh, it is said that maths majors are all somehow masochists. Most of them, anyway. You know, \u0026ldquo;No pain no gain.\u0026rdquo;\nI shall start with basic definitions.\nDef(3-dimensional curve) A parametrized curve in 3-dimensional Euclidean space is a continuous map $\\alpha: I \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ of an open interval $I = (a,b)$ of the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ into $\\mathbb{R}^3$. As for $\\alpha = (x(t),y(t),z(t))$, $t$ is the parameter of line $\\alpha$. Image set${x(t),y(t),z(t)}$ is the graph of line $\\alpha$.\nSo, differential geometry, we want the methods of differential calculus can be applied.\nDef(differential curve) A parametrized differentiable curve is a continuous differentiable map. As for $\\alpha = (x(t),y(t),z(t))$, $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $z(t)$ are all $C^\\infty$ functions.\nOne obvious simple instance of non-differential curve is absolute value function.\nThose two properties above, continuity and differentiability, seem to be enough for a certain curve in Euclidean space to be analysed easily. However, all the textbooks taught me \u0026ldquo;regularity\u0026rdquo; were forgoten12. What exactly is \u0026ldquo;regularity\u0026rdquo; they mentioned here? I shall read the definition again.\nDef(regular curve) A parametrized differentiable curve $\\alpha: \\alpha(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$ is regular if $$\\forall t \\in (a,b), |\\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t)| = \\sqrt{[x\u0026rsquo;(t)]^2 +[y\u0026rsquo;(t)]^2 + [z\u0026rsquo;(t)]^2}\u0026gt; 0.$$\nWe want to insure that the curve we consider has a tangent line at every point. Frenet frame, a powerful tool for analysis, consists of three vectors orthogonal to each other: unit tangent vector $\\bm{t}$, unit normal vector $\\bm{n}$, unit binormal vector $\\bm{b}$. Both $\\bm{n}$ and $\\bm{b}$ come from $\\bm{t}$ parallel to the tangent line. What if the derivative of $\\alpha(t_0)$ was a zero vector? Unfortunately, such tangent line might not exist at $t_0$, and dear Frenet frame couldn\u0026rsquo;t work. Frent frame is only a small example to show why WE NEED TANGENT LINEs EVERYWHERE.\ne.g. Consider such a plane curve, $\\alpha: \\alpha(t) = (t^4, t^2, t^3)$. Of course it\u0026rsquo;s differentiable. Notice that $\\alpha\u0026rsquo;(0) = (0,0,0)$, the velocity vector is zero for $t = 0$, so this curve is not regular. You can check its figure below. Pay attention to $(0,0,0)$, the curve isn\u0026rsquo;t smooth there.\nSomeone (like me) prefer to play devil’s advocate: how can a non-zero derivative demonstrate the existence of the tangent line to the curve? The proof is as followed.\nProof Assume $\\alpha: \\alpha(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))$ is a differential curve. According to the definition of derivative of vector function, $\\forall t_0 \\in (a,b)$, $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big\\vert_{t_0} = (\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t},\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t},\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t})\\Big\\vert_{t_0} = \\lim_{t \\to t_0} \\frac{\\alpha(t) - \\alpha(t_0)}{t-t_0}. $$ According to differentiability, $$ \\lim_{t \\to t_0-0} \\frac{\\alpha(t_0) - \\alpha(t)}{t-t_0} = \\lim_{t \\to t_0+0} \\frac{\\alpha(t) - \\alpha(t_0)}{t-t_0}, $$ i.e. $\\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0-0) = \\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0+0)$. The unit direction vector of the left tangent line is $$ \\bm{e}^-(t_0) = -\\lim_{t\\to t_0 - 0} \\frac{\\alpha(t) - \\alpha(t_0)}{|\\alpha(t) - \\alpha(t_0)|}; $$ The unit direction vector of the right tangent line is $$ \\bm{e}^+(t_0) = +\\lim_{t\\to t_0 + 0} \\frac{\\alpha(t) - \\alpha(t_0)}{|\\alpha(t) - \\alpha(t_0)|}. $$ Obviously, iff. $\\bm{e}^-(t_0) = \\bm{e}^+(t_0) = \\bm{e}$, the tangent line to $\\alpha$ at $t_0$ exists, and its direction vector is just $\\bm{e}$.\n$\\bm{e}^-(t_0) \\parallel \\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0-0)$, $\\bm{e}^+(t_0) \\parallel \\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0+0)$. If $\\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0 - 0) = \\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0 + 0) = \\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0) \\neq \\bm{0}$, $\\bm{e}^-(t_0)$ and $\\bm{e}^+(t_0)$ would get to the same direction, hence they are equal.\nQ.E.D.\nThis proof tells us $\\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0) \\neq \\bm{0} \\Rightarrow $ tangent line exists. In contrast, can we say there\u0026rsquo;s no tangent line if $\\alpha\u0026rsquo;(t_0) = \\bm{0}$? Sorry, just take a look at $\\alpha: \\alpha(t) = (t^3, t^3)$.\nMANFREDO P. DO CARMO.

Generator Hexo and theme Hiya were adopted at very first, and the site was in rough compared to how it looks now. Later something upset me a lot and I almost gave up this site.\nRecently one of my old school friends has started blogging on his WeChat official account, which inspired me to rebuild and restart the site. It took me more than twenty hours to finish this work. This time I chose generator Hugo and theme Stack. I followed a zigzag course, as I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert in front-end design, and those documents in full English were difficult for me. Fortunately everything was completed and the site seems in good condition, at least currently. It\u0026rsquo;s no doubt that this blog is no match for platforms like Weibo, Zhihu and WeChat in SEO, but that\u0026rsquo;s what makes it a drift bottle and I like this. In addition, the URL won\u0026rsquo;t change since I have no money to buy a custom realm name.\nThe about page written one year ago is as followed.\n高中的时候就考虑过建立个人网站，但迫于个人知识狭隘和学业繁忙一直没实操。\n最近形政课开展一个调研课题，没地方发放我的调查问卷，于是建了一个网站来推广。\n以上是本站诞生的“导火索”了。\n作为计算机二级都没过的小白，开发这个网站可谓“溯洄从之，道阻且长”。\n本人没系统读过计算机，也不懂什么前端后端，就是偶尔折腾着玩儿。\n这两天我看了网上各种鱼龙混杂的信息，走了很多弯路。最后的网站是基于GitHub和Hexo实现。\n之所以把网站部署在GitHub上，最主要是因为它免费。\n另外，我很看好GitHub。它作为目前全球最大的同性交友平台代码开源平台，无数程序设计者的智慧在其中凝结。\n“开源”对任何求知者都有着致命的诱惑。你的身旁将有无数志同道合者，你们将屹立于巨人的肩膀上。\n在任何年代，只要存在知识分享，“开源”就永不过时。\n我建立本站时主要的考量是稳定，GitHub的开源性就是它可持续的保障。\n比起外部环境变化，我更担心“内部敌人”的瓦解。\n如果哪天本人心态爆炸，永不更新，那这个小站岂不会遗失在互联网的烟海里？\n哎无所谓了，人本就是“寄蜉蝣于天地，渺沧海之一粟”。\n能来这里的都是有缘人，毕竟我既不是技术大牛，又没做过什么推广。\n诸位能光临本寒舍，不胜感激。\n","date":"2023-11-26T23:51:46+08:00","image":"https://realyezhihao.github.io/en/posts/hello-world/cover_hud7e36f7e20e71be184458283bdae4646_55974_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://realyezhihao.github.io/en/posts/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"}]
